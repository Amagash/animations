# Animations

Welcome to the animations project to create animations for better explaining concepts. 

## Installation
Please follow the instructions from the [Manim community](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

## Quick start
You can create your first animation by running the following command in the terminal:

```
manim -pql scene.py AnimatedSquareToCircle
```

This will generate a media folder/videos where the videos will be saved in mp4.
